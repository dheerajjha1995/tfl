                    Objective:
                </h1>
                <p>One of the roles of “design” defined by the guidelines of MSME states that design is doing things better,
                    improving a situation, making a positive difference. Keeping this in view and aligning with the objectives
                    of the initiative by MSME, GoI, i.e., continuous improvement and value addition for existing products
                    including new products, TOOFUNLabs aims toward developing holistic STEAM kits in different stages that
                    will act as a teaching-learning aid for school children. In North-East, Assam holds the most MSME enterprises,
                    however the development of STEAM kits as compared to the rest of the parts of India is very low in this
                    region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, most of the STEAM kits available in market are not holistic in the sense that one
                    kit normally is dedicated to one aspect of STEAM. Moreover, concentration of technology,
                    engineering and agriculture is to be increased in the STEAM kits manufactured in India.
                    Hence, TOOFUNLabs will create kits in three different levels, each level including smaller
                    kits for every direction of STEAM. The kits are proposed based on the CBSE syllabus (as the
                    state board and CBSE syllabus are now the same), such that these will help the students to
                    have an elevated perspective on the topics taught in classroom and also give them a glimpse
                    of the application of the topics in the real world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The TOOFUNLab app and workshops/training programs will train the teachers in the usage of
                    the kits as well as related software platforms, so that they can use these in the classroom
                    as teaching aids. Additionally, they can also use the kits to train the interested student
                    during the summer/winter breaks. It is to be noted that the TOOFUNLab kits will also cover
                    arts and crafts, so that students can enjoy the truly diverse nature of education.
